## Strategic Problem Solving Through Technology

### Current Focus

I identify productivity gaps in development workflows and build complete solutions to solve them. Recently saw teams struggling with the Rails vs modern JS productivity gap, so I built [Bun Stack](https://bun-stack.jasenc.dev) - a complete framework that gets teams from idea to deployed application in minutes instead of hours.

### Unique Value Proposition

My background combines **MBA strategic thinking, AI expertise, and full-stack technical execution** - a rare combination that allows me to both identify market needs and build the complete solutions to address them. I understand business requirements, emerging technology trends, and have the technical capability to deliver production-ready systems.

**Strategic + Technical Projects:**
- **Bun Stack** - Identified developer productivity gap, built complete framework with user management, admin tools, and production deployment
- **AI Cost Optimization** - Architected local AI solutions delivering 60%+ cost savings while maintaining performance  
- **Portfolio Platform** - Built with embedded AI capabilities and modern tooling to demonstrate technical leadership

### What Sets Me Apart

I bridge the gap between business strategy and technical execution. While many engineers focus solely on implementation, I combine **MBA-level strategic thinking** with deep technical skills to identify problems worth solving and build complete solutions that drive business impact.

**Strategic capabilities:**
- **Product thinking** - Identifying market gaps and user needs
- **Business impact** - Understanding ROI, cost optimization, and team productivity metrics  
- **Technical leadership** - Full-stack execution with systems that scale across organizations
- **AI integration** - Leveraging emerging technologies for competitive advantage

### Target Role Alignment

Perfect fit for **Technical Product Manager, VP Engineering, or Solutions Engineering** roles where success requires both strategic vision and hands-on technical leadership. I can identify what to build, architect the solution, and execute the implementation.

### Engineering Background

My non-traditional path from medical device quality engineering brings a unique perspective. I understand the full product lifecycle, risk management, and quality processes essential in mission-critical systems. This experience shaped my approach to building robust, well-architected solutions that teams can rely on.

### Tech Stack

Modern JavaScript (React, TypeScript, Bun.js), cloud infrastructure, AI integration, full-stack development. I choose proven technologies that let teams focus on building features instead of debugging framework issues.

### Looking Ahead

Targeting **Solutions Engineering, Technical Product Manager, or VP Engineering** roles where I can combine strategic product thinking with hands-on technical leadership. Most effective in fast-growing companies that value identifying market opportunities and building complete solutions to capture them.

*Continuously identifying problems worth solving and building the technical solutions to address them.*
