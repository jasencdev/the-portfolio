## Building Tools That Make Teams Move Faster

### Current Focus

I create production-ready frameworks and tools that eliminate friction in the development process. Recently built [Bun Stack](https://bun-stack.jasenc.dev), a complete full-stack framework in three afternoons that gets teams from idea to deployed application in minutes. This kind of rapid execution with robust architecture is what I specialize in.

### Technical Approach

My background in pharmaceutical quality engineering taught me systems thinking and reliability standards—but I apply that rigor at startup speed. I understand that software exists to solve business problems, so I build tools that balance immediate productivity gains with long-term maintainability.

### What Sets Me Apart

I don't just write code—I create the frameworks, tools, and systems that unlock entire team velocity. Whether it's a development framework or cost-optimized AI infrastructure, I focus on building solutions that have multiplier effects across organizations.

**Technical philosophy:**
- **Ship working solutions** over endless optimization
- **Build for teams** not just individual productivity  
- **Systems thinking** from regulated industry experience
- **Business impact** drives technical decisions

### Engineering Background

My non-traditional path from medical device quality engineering brings a unique perspective. I understand the full product lifecycle, risk management, and quality processes essential in mission-critical systems. This experience shaped my approach to building robust, well-architected solutions that teams can rely on.

### Tech Stack

Modern JavaScript (React, TypeScript, Bun.js), cloud infrastructure, AI integration, full-stack development. I choose proven technologies that let teams focus on building features instead of debugging framework issues.

### Looking Ahead

I'm targeting technical leadership roles where I can combine strategic thinking with hands-on execution. Most energized by environments that value shipping working solutions and iterating rapidly.

*Continuously building, learning, and creating software that makes teams more effective.*
