## Strategic Problem Solving Through Technology

### Current Focus

I design and build solutions that eliminate friction in development workflows.
Recently, I saw teams stuck between the productivity of Rails and the sprawl of modern JavaScript tooling — so I built [**Bun Stack**](https://bun-stack.jasenc.dev): a curated fullstack framework that gets you from idea to production in 30 seconds.

### My Thesis

> **Open-sourcing competence at scale.**
> I build systems that distill years of engineering into tools others can use instantly.

### Unique Value Proposition

I operate at the intersection of **business strategy, AI, and full-stack technical execution** — a combination that enables me to spot market gaps, architect viable solutions, and ship production-ready platforms.

---

## Strategic + Technical Projects

* **Bun Stack** – Built a full-stack platform seed with routing, auth, admin, and deploy in <30s
* **AI Cost Optimization** – Architected local AI pipelines with 60%+ cost reduction vs cloud APIs
* **Portfolio Platform** – Integrated AI-driven components into a production-grade developer portfolio

---

### What Sets Me Apart

Most engineers ship features.
I ship **leverage** — frameworks, systems, and workflows that improve speed, reliability, and clarity across entire teams.

* **Product thinking** – Translate ambiguity into buildable platforms
* **Business impact** – Optimize for ROI, developer velocity, and team productivity
* **Technical leadership** – End-to-end architecture that scales cleanly
* **AI integration** – Embed practical machine learning into user-facing and infrastructure layers

---

## Background

My path began in **medical device quality engineering**, where system failures weren’t options.
That experience shaped my approach to software: risk-aware, outcome-driven, and built for scale.
I didn’t pivot to tech — I translated regulated systems thinking into developer platforms.

---

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind
* **Backend:** Bun.js, SQLite/Postgres, Drizzle ORM
* **Infra:** CI/CD, Docker, Railway
* **AI:** Local-first LLMs via Open WebUI, Ollama, and custom orchestration

I use proven technologies that reduce time-to-value — so teams can focus on building, not debugging.

---

## Looking Ahead

I'm targeting roles where **strategic clarity meets technical execution**:

* **Technical Product Manager** – Understand the problem, define the vision, ship the solution
* **Solutions Engineer** – Rapidly build working systems to close deals and drive adoption
* **VP Engineering** – Architect the platform, lead the team, scale the system

Most effective in fast-moving companies that need leverage, not just velocity.
