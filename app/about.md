# About

I'm a full-stack engineer building production systems, developer tools, and self-hosted infrastructure.

## What I'm Working On

**Home Lab Infrastructure** — I recently deployed a two-node K3s cluster over Tailscale, running n8n for workflow automation. The setup lets me access self-hosted services from anywhere without exposing ports or managing VPNs. Next up: a job search automation agent that scrapes postings, scores them against my profile, and queues matches for review.

**Bun Stack** — A fullstack framework that gets you from idea to production in 30 seconds. Bun runtime, React, TypeScript, Drizzle ORM, auth, admin panel, and one-command deploy to Railway. I built it because I was tired of the boilerplate tax on every new project.

**Local AI Infrastructure** — Self-hosted LLM setup using Open WebUI and Ollama on bare metal Ubuntu. Runs inference locally with custom APIs, cutting cloud AI costs by 60%+.

## Background

I spent 10+ years in medical device quality engineering, where system failures meant FDA warning letters and product recalls. That experience shaped how I think about software: understand failure modes, build in observability, and design systems that degrade gracefully.

I didn't pivot to tech — I translated regulated systems thinking into software engineering. Root cause analysis becomes debugging methodology. Validation protocols become test coverage. Risk management becomes reliability engineering.

## Tech Stack

**Languages:** TypeScript, Python, Go, SQL

**Frontend:** React, Vue, Tailwind, VitePress

**Backend:** Bun.js, Node, Flask, Gin

**Data:** PostgreSQL, SQLite, Drizzle ORM, Elasticsearch

**Infrastructure:** K3s, Docker, Tailscale, Railway, CI/CD pipelines

**AI/ML:** Ollama, Open WebUI, scikit-learn, local-first LLM deployment

## What I'm Looking For

Full-stack or backend engineering roles at small-to-mid-sized companies building developer tools, infrastructure, or platforms. I work well in environments that value shipping over process theater and evaluate people on output rather than credentials.

Interested in: observability, workflow automation, compliance-as-code, developer experience, and anything that makes engineers more productive.

Remote preferred. Based in Philadelphia.
