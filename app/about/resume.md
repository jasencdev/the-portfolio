## Experience

### **Founder & Software Engineer** — *jasenc.dev* — Sep 2024 - Present

- Designed and deployed a K-means clustering-based recipe recommendation engine using Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit, optimizing search efficiency for 150K+ recipes through cluster optimization using elbow and silhouette analysis and feature selection techniques that improved recommendation accuracy.
- Built an end-to-end ML pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model deployment on Railway, leveraging containerization with Docker to reduce response time for recommendations.
- Replaced React Router blog with VitePress in 24 hour sprint — with continuous delivery.
  - Optimized SEO through Google Search Console integration and structured metadata, while implementing dual-hosting: staging on Railway, production on Netlify, with CI/CD pipeline automation.
- Launched Single Page Application (SPA) for company presence using Vite, React Router, and Chakra UI - provides portfolio for examples of services, blog for social platform, with full MDX support.
- Deployed Open WebUI running Microsoft's Phi-4 locally with Ollama to a private domain, enhancing security and self-hosting benefits.
  - [Projects — Self-Hosted Language Model](../projects/language-model.md)
  - Built custom APIs for local inference with Ollama, significantly reducing cloud compute costs and dependency on expensive frontier models.
