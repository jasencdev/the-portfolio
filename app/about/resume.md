## Summary

Full-stack engineer and systems thinker with a background in pharmaceutical and medical device quality. I build production-grade developer tools, ML-powered platforms, and infrastructure that unlocks shipping velocity and strategic leverage for teams. I combine backend engineering, local AI deployment, and cloud architecture to eliminate friction and reduce cost across the software lifecycle.

## Experience

### **Founder & Systems Engineer** — *jasenc.dev* — Sep 2024 – Present

* Built [**Bun Stack**](https://bun-stack.jasenc.dev): a production-grade fullstack framework using Bun, React, and TypeScript. Enabled teams to deploy secure, full-featured apps in under 30 seconds.
* Architected and deployed local-first LLM infrastructure using Open WebUI + Ollama. Self-hosted Microsoft Phi-4 with custom APIs for inference, cutting cloud AI spend by over 60%.
* Designed and deployed a K-means clustering-based recipe recommendation engine using Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit. Optimized clustering using silhouette scoring and feature selection.
* Built full ML pipeline: preprocessing, model training, deployment with Docker to Railway. Achieved <1s latency under real load.
* Replaced a custom React blog with VitePress in a 24-hour sprint. Implemented structured metadata, automated CI/CD, and dual-hosted on Railway and Netlify.
* Launched SPA portfolio platform using Vite, React Router, and Chakra UI with MDX support. Serves as a content system and technical showcase.
