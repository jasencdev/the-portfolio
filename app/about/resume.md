## Experience

### **Full-Stack Data Engineer** — *jasenc.dev* — Sep 2024 – Present

**Machine Learning & Data Analytics:**

* Designed and deployed a K-means clustering-based recipe recommendation engine using Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit. Optimized clustering using silhouette scoring and feature selection.
* Built full ML pipeline: data preprocessing, model training, containerized deployment with Docker to Railway. Achieved <1s latency under production load.
* Architected and deployed local-first LLM infrastructure using Open WebUI + Ollama on bare metal Ubuntu. Self-hosted Microsoft Phi-4 with custom APIs for inference, cutting cloud AI spend by over 60%.

**Data Infrastructure & Database Engineering:**

* Built [**Bun Stack**](https://bun-stack.jasenc.dev): a production-grade fullstack framework using Bun, React, and TypeScript with Drizzle ORM for database resilience. Implemented SQLite fallback mechanism when PostgreSQL connections fail, ensuring zero downtime data access.
* Integrated PostgreSQL as backend for Open WebUI production environments, improving stability and scalability through optimized permissions and proper database configuration.
* Developed production-ready Flask microblogging platform with PostgreSQL backend, implementing database migrations, user authentication, and social features with comprehensive data modeling.
* Implemented full-text search capabilities using Elasticsearch for content discovery, relevance-based ranking, and fuzzy matching across large datasets.

**Full-Stack Development & Platform Engineering:**

* Architected modern portfolio site using VitePress/Vue frontend with Go/Gin backend, featuring server-side rendering, automated CI/CD, and multi-platform deployment.
* Implemented continuous delivery pipeline using Railway for feature branch deployments, maintaining always-deployable code and eliminating integration surprises.
* Migrated applications from Heroku to Railway, achieving 40% cost reduction while improving performance through usage-based pricing and faster container spin-up times.
* Secured self-hosted AI infrastructure using Tailscale VPN with end-to-end encryption for private network deployment.

### **Senior Quality Engineer** — *PCI* — Sep 2023 – Present

**Statistical Analysis & Data Validation:**

* Lead Quality Engineer for auto-injector sustainment and new product introduction for pharmaceutical accounts (Eli Lilly, Merck, GSK).
* Developed standard operating procedures for performing statistical techniques in calculating capability of critical-to-quality attributes.
* Implemented change controls for software solutions in dose accuracy calculation, including validation of computational models and oversight of automated scale solutions.

**Change Control & Corrective / Preventive Actions:**

* Lead Quality Engineer for auto-injector sustainment and new product introduction for pharmaceutical accounts (Eli Lilly, Merck, GSK).
* Developed standard operating procedures for performing statistical techniques in calculating capability of critical-to-quality attributes.
* Implemented change controls for software solutions in dose accuracy calculation, including validation of computational models and oversight of automated scale solutions.

### **Quality Engineering & Validation** — *Various Companies* — 2012 – 2023

**Systems & Process Validation:**

* Managed validation of measurement systems and statistical tools for decision-making regarding sampling sizes and acceptance criteria.
* Led data gathering and analysis for various KPIs, reducing CAPA load from 150+ to 75 active items through systematic data-driven approaches.
* Performed risk-based validation planning for processes and software systems, ensuring data integrity and regulatory compliance.
* Specialized in parsing dense technical/regulatory documentation (FDA CFRs, ISO standards) and translating into validation procedures and SOPs.
